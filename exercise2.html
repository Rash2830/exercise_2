                <p>Sheikh Hasina said, 'Why is there so much anger against the liberation war and freedom fighters? The

                    the freedom fighters will not get? So will Razakar's grandchildren get? My question is to the

                    Razakar's grandchildren get jobs, not freedom fighters. What is the crime? By risking his life, he
                    threw away everything
                    and took part in the liberation war. Day and night without eating, breaking the clay, fighting
                    sun-rain-storm brought
                    victory to this country. All are sitting in high positions because they brought victory.Students
                    came down to the streets in the middle of the night claiming that the protesters were insulted by
                    Hasina's
                    speech. Munna, a protesting student, said, "We have taken to the streets to protest against the
                    Prime Minister's
                    speech." I am not getting the title of Razaka because I am agitating for logical demands.
                    During the road blockade, the protesting students were seen chanting 'Tumie ke Ami Ke, Razakar,
                    Razakar', 'Cheye Chilam

                        to join the movement?</b>
                    When people were being suppressed in different places, when the gruesome photographs were flashing
                    before us or when Abu
                    Sayeed was shot dead, we actually had no other choice but to be organised. The university students
                    joined the movement
                    from their own standpoints. We thought to ourselves that police shooting and beating the students it
                    cannot be the
                    picture of Bangladesh!
                    Students of private universities spontaneously joined the movement against this repression. As the
                    time demanded,
                    leaders or coordinators have also been created from amongst the students. Students usually circulate
                    about the
                    programmes using social media. After the internet was shut down, we kept in touch with each other
                    through text messages.
                    We tried to send a common message to everyone. Once the broadband internet resumed, we restored
                    communication again
                    using social media and various messaging apps.</p>

                    university.

                    The notice came after police and stick-wielding youths ganged up on the university’s students at its
                    campus in Dhaka’s
                    Rampura today.

                    Due to unavoidable circumstances, the university will remain closed for all students, faculty
                    members, administrative
                    officers and staff on Tuesday, 7 August 2018 and Wednesday, 8 August 2018. The university will
                    reopen on Thursday, 9 August 2018, as
                    usual, says the notice undersigned by Mashfiqur Rahman, acting registrar of the university.

                    The university has also suspended all the examinations and evening classes from August 09 to August
                    11 2018, according to the

                    But those from different public and private universities occupied the streets at different parts of
                    the city in the
                    morning and eventually clashed with police and pro-government activists.

                    The students fought running battles with the police for around five and a half hours at Aftabnagar

                    condemned the arrest.

                    According to an official in the cyber crime division of the Dhaka metropolitan police, up to 1,200
                    social media accounts
                    have been identified to allegedly spread rumours. In addition to police officers, members of
                    pro-government youth league
                    BCL, also asked followers to send examples of anyone allegedly spreading rumours. Posts featuring
                    the names and pictures
                    of alleged activists including four women were spread across Facebook and Instagram. These actions
                    have made many
                    students in Dhaka to panic and made them stop posting about the protests online.There are also

                <p>Hasina resigned after weeks of protests against quotas for government jobs flared into nationwide
                    unrest. At least 280
