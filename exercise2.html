                <p>Protesting against the arbitrary killing of students, withdrawal of cases, release of
                    missing-arrested students and
                    opening of hall-campus, the agitating students carried out wall writing and graffiti drawing program
                    centered on the
                    quota reform movement. This program was held on Sunday in various campuses of the country in
                    response to the
                    anti-discrimination student movement on the platform of the agitators.

                <h2 style="color: red;">FLOOD FOR THE BLOOD 35th July</h2>
                <p>Without a doubt, sushi is one of Japan's greatest gastronomical gifts to the world. Almost poetic in
                    its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the freshness of the ingredients and the knife
                    skills of the chef.
                    Whether you like your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in toasted
                    nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can be found in every price
                    range.The sushi at Sushisho Masa in Roppongi is nothing short of perfection. At around Â¥20,000
                    ($200) per person, it's a splurge, but perfection doesn't come cheap.</p>

                <p>There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's streets, especially in the
                    summertime, when humidity levels soar and the concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves.
                    "Being on a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city,
                    inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm
                    behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down the
                    streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all
                    the while still breathing the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be
                    intoxicating," says Chung.</p>

                <p> Many of those cliches about postcard-pretty coastal New England towns got their start in the same
                    place: Newport, Rhode Island.The town is best known for being a summer getaway for America's
                    aristocracy during the Gilded Age, with wealthy families like the Vanderbilts, the Dukes and Astors
                    all owning summer homes there (they say "cottage," we say "ginormous mansion") and throwing
                    glamorous parties.Although more of the luxurious estates are museums than homes these days, Newport
                    hasn't lost its seaside charm -- especially in the summer. Here's our guide to the best things to

                <p>Just minutes before the Humane Society Shelter in Bangor, Maine closed for the day on Tuesday, they
                    only had one lone puppy left who had yet to be adopted. Not to worry however, that puppy too found a
                    great forever home, marking the end of an amazing campaign to save some dogs on death row from a
                    high-kill shelter in the southern United States.Ada Webb was the lucky person to adopt that final
                    dog. Webb had been in line there for quite some time waiting to adopt, hoping to be able to surprise
                    her nine-year-old son with a new, four-legged furry family member. </p>

                    dealing with some very sticky issues. The social network is facing increasing pressure to address
